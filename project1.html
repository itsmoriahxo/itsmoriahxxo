        <h1>Moriah Oliveira</h1>
        
        <p> Its a new era for college athletes, particularly women. Thats the message Adidas sent with a historic signing of 15 
            female student-athletes on the 50th anniversary of Title IX to kick off the brands planned NIL network.One of the 
            athletes selected was former Evangelical Christian School track star Moriah Oliveira, who is currently blazing past 
            the competition at the University of Miami.</p>
         
        <p>Fresh off a strong season that saw her win the 400-meter race at the indoor ACC Championships and qualify for the 
            outdoor NCAA championships for the first time, Oliveira was the only track athlete in the country chosen to represent
            the 3-stripes.Oliveira described the campaign being tied to the Title IX anniversary as empowering. In her view, 
            Adidas is setting an example for other brands.</p> 
            
        <p>Oliveira, a sophomore on the Canes along with her twin sister Sierra, was flown to Los Angeles for photo shoots and 
            took a trip to New York earlier last week with the other athletes for the announcement event. The launch featured 
            appearances from sports icons Billie Jean King and Candace Parker as well as Peloton instructor Ally Love.</p>    
         
         <h2>Early Days</h2> 
            
        <p>At the age of 13, my father decided to sign me up for the varsity track & field team when I was just a 6th grader. 
            Given the rules of my private school, in middle school I was already allowed to practice and compete with varsity highschool
            athletes along side my twin sister. We quickly found a love for the sport and progressed significantly as we grew older.
            By our sophmore year we had both collected two state championship titles, multiple district titles, and several regional
            titles. 

        <p>As our Junior year of highschool approached we were set on winning not only individual titles but a team title as well. Never 
            in our highschools history had a team won a state title. With hard work and dedication we were the first womens team to bring
            back a 1A Florida State title and as our talent progressed, we soon realized we could run at the next level. 
        
        <p>We set our sights on all the division one track programs in Florida and finally signed to the University of Miami our Senior year of highschool.
            The University of Miami signed me as an athlete for the following events</p>    
           

        <ol>
            <li>400 Meter Dash</li>
            <li>200 Meter Dash</li>
            <li>4X4 Meter Relay</li>
        </ol>

         <h2>Love for the Sport</h2>

        <p>As I have started my college career my love for the sport has only grown. Learning how to be disciplined and train my body to be the best 
            it can possible be has had its challenges, but I am extremly proud of the progress I have made here at Miami. Not only
            has my love for the sport grown, but my knowledge of track and field has expanded.</p>


        <p> With the help of my amazing coaches, I have been able to preform at the national level and become a 2x ACC champion. The following are 
        my personal records that I am looking to beat this year.</p>

        <P>As I continue on this amazing college journey I try not to get too caught up in what the future holds for me.
            But I do know this. I will continue to do what makes me happy, and give this sport everything I have until
            I cant anymore!</P>
